    title: 'HOW COULD CONNOR BEDARD\'S INJURY AFFECT HIS CALDER TROPHY BID?',
    text:
        'Chicago Blackhawks star rookie Connor Bedard suffered a setback Friday, when he collided with New Jersey defenseman Brendan Smith and fractured his jaw. The 18-year-old has been far and away the NHL’s top freshman, with 15 goals and 33 points in 39 games. He’s got nine more points than the next-best rookie – Columbus center Adam Fantilli. Bedard’s going to be sidelined indefinitely, possibly four to six weeks, adding to the Hawks’ significant injury woes.By the time Bedard returns, the race for the Calder Trophy as the NHL’s top rookie will probably be much tighter. Along with Fantilli (24 points), the other top rookies this season in terms of points are Minnesota Wild forward Marco Rossi (23 points), and Devils defenseman Luke Hughes (22 points). Those rookies could have between now and February or March to catch up to Bedard in the points race. Given that each of those three are currently averaging about 0.60 points per game, they’ll probably get close to or right at Bedard’s current points total.Let’s presume Bedard’s injury is more severe, and he’s out until early March. That would still give him about 20 regular-season games to get back in top form and once again average nearly one point per game. That would put his production in the area of 55 points, and that’s probably going to be at or near the top of the list of rookies in the points department. Fantilli, Hughes and Rossi will almost assuredly be in that race as well, but they haven’t shown the dominance we’ve seen from Bedard in his first NHL season. We also need to factor in the possibility one of those three rookies also gets injured; if that happens to any of the three we’ve named, catching Bedard will be next to impossible.Most hockey observers projected Bedard to win the Calder this season, including 25 of THN\'s 33 respondents in a pre-season poll, and people have had good reason for that projection. The other rookies will probably be terrific NHLers over the long haul, but at the moment, they’re simply not as good as Bedard. If the voting for the Calder was done today, there’d be no question Bedard should win it. He shouldn’t be pushed out of the Calder race because of this injury. Indeed, when he does return and continues to maul opponents with his craftiness and instincts, Bedard will confirm he’s the best first-year player in the game.',

      text:
          'This year\'s NHL All-Star Weekend in Toronto will feature some fresh twists. First, let\'s talk about what\'s the same. The 3-on-3 tournament format for Saturday\'s All-Star Game day remains, and fans are still invited to help select some of the participants.From now until Jan. 11, voting is open. Fans can cast their ballots for their favorite eight skaters and four goaltenders at NHL.com/vote and on the NHL App, as well as at X (formerly Twitter).But the four teams of nine skaters and two goalies won\'t represent the league\'s divisions this year. For the first time since 2015, the All-Star Draft is returning. On Thursday, Feb. 1, four NHL captains will each collaborate with a celebrity to select their game rosters.Last year, fans could only vote for two players and one goaltender from each division, which narrowed the field. This time around, the options are wide open. The eight skaters and four goaltenders on a ballot can come from any team so we could end up seeing greater representation from one division or one conference, depending on how the votes shake down.As a reminder: one player from each team was named to the all-star roster on Thursday. Here are those lists — first from the Eastern Conference',

          'NHL THREE STARS: STARS SECOND-LINER, MAPLE LEAFS GOALIE AND PANTHERS POWER FORWARD IMPRESS',
      text:
          'Welcome back to the three stars of the week, a regular THN.com file in which we pick out three NHL players who had the biggest impact on their team in the last seven days. Let’s get to it:3. MATTHEW TKACHUK, FLORIDA PANTHER Tkachuk was third in the league in points this week but first in points per game, with eight (including five assists) in just three games. One of his three goals was a game-winner against the Vegas Golden Knights.He’s now amassed 27 assists and 35 points in 39 games. The 26-year-old winger is on pace for a 56-assist, 73-point season – while that’s a dropoff of about 30 points from his previous two seasons, Tkachuk is averaging less ice time at 18:52 per game, and the Panthers likely want him to be a little fresher by the playoffs.Tkachuk is earning \$9.5 million this season, so ideally, his totals on offense would be better than they are at the moment. However, Florida is romping right now, winning seven games in a row, and Tkachuk’s contributions are noteworthy. He’s an antagonist, but he can back it up with effective play.We expect his offensive numbers to rise, and if they do, the Panthers should remain at or near the top of the Atlantic Division.2. MARTIN JONES, TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS Jones began the season with the AHL’s Toronto Marlies but was recalled in December after Joseph Woll\'s injury. Jones rewarded GM Brad Treliving’s faith in him with an excellent showing this past week.The 33-year-old netminder went 3-0-0 with a sterling 0.66 goals-against average, a .976 save percentage and one shutout. He now has a record of 7-3-0 in 11 appearances this season, along with a 2.08 GAA and .932 SP in that span. Those numbers are his best since the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons when he was the top goalie for the San Jose Sharks.Jones is earning just \$875,000 this year, making him one of the best bargains in the league right now. Maple Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe is going to give youngster Woll opportunities in net when he returns from injury, but Jones has established himself as a solid option as a tandem mate for Woll.At his age, Jones is expected to lose a step, but the opposite has been true; he’s been terrific positionally, he hasn’t gotten rattled on the rare occasion he does surrender a goal, and he’s allowed Toronto’s offense to power the Buds to victory. Treliving couldn’t have asked for more from Jones than what he’s delivering, and the Leafs are going to ride him until the wheels fall off.1. MASON MARCHMENT, DALLAS STARSMarchment tied for the league lead this week with six assists and nine points in four games while averaging just 16:15 of ice time. All six of his assists came at even-strength, and he now has 13 goals and 30 points in 38 games this season. The 28-year-old is on pace for a 28-goal, 64-point campaign, which would demolish his current career highs of 18 goals and 47 points, both set with Florida in 2021-22.',

      title: 'THN ARCHIVE: BREAKING DOWN HOCKEY\'S UNWRITTEN CODE',
      text:
          'The hockey world has its official rules, but it also has an unwritten code players and hockey people live by. And in this cover story from The Hockey News’ Dec. 7, 2004 edition – Vol. 58, Issue 15 – senior writer Mark Brender wrote on the code itself.(And here’s your regular reminder – for full access to THN’s 76-year Archive, you need only subscribe to the magazine.)In Brender’s story, he chronicles all the unwritten rules players live by. Some of them have changed since the story was published, but for the most part, the unwritten code remains intact. And in Brender’s story, he writes about a number of areas: in the dressing room; on the ice; during the game; the fighter’s code; after the game; on the road; and around the rink. Each area has its own regulations, written and otherwise, and players and hockey people abide by them each and every year.For example, Brender spoke to then-Canadiens blueliner Lyle Odelein wanted to fight in the midst of a one-sided game against Buffalo. Odelein wanted to take on someone from the Sabres, and when they didn’t respond to his liking, Odelein took matters into his own hands.“I skated by the bench and I told Teddy, ‘OK, Teddy, throw out your boys,” Odelein told Brender. “And he basically told me, go get ’em myself. So I said, ‘All right Teddy’. And that’s why I shot the puck at their bench.”Meanwhile, on the road in the minors, rookie players are given the task of cleaning the bus players ride on. And in-room politics can force rookies to take on a big challenge in that regard.“If some guys don’t like some young guys,” says John Slaney, a veteran blueliner for the American League’s Philadelphia Phantoms, “you can make the bus pretty dirty.”All in all, Brender covered a slew of rules from “the code”, and most of them still apply to this day. Then-Sabres coach Ted Nolan spoke about the code from his point of view.“I’ve always loved aggressive hockey, but I don’t like stupid hockey,” Nolan said. “If people want to get even, my theory is you get even at the beginning of the game when the game is in reach, not when it’s out of reach. That’s when people start doing some stupid things. I always took the reverse action to that. When it was over, it was over. We’ll get them next time.”',

      title: 'NEW JERSEY DEVILS STILL SEEK A GOALTENDER AND A DEFENSEMAN',
      text:
          'The New Jersey Devils were 10-9-1 in their first 20 games, sitting 12th overall in the Eastern Conference as of Nov. 28. That prompted speculation GM Tom Fitzgerald was in the market for a goaltending upgrade over his then-tandem of Vitek Vanecek and Akira Schmid.Since then, the Devils went 10-5-1 heading into Friday\'s matchup with the Chicago Blackhawks and are jockeying for the final Eastern Conference wild-card berth. Nevertheless, speculation persists that Fitzgerald is still seeking help between the pipes.lVanecek has a record of 13-7-1, but his 3.35 goals-against average and .883 save percentage rank among the worst for NHL starters this season. Schmid fared little better before his recent assignment to their AHL affiliate in Utica, going 5-7-1 with 3.26 GAA and .893 SP. Call-up Nico Daws has won his two starts with a 2.52 GAA and .906 SP.During an appearance Wednesday on the NHL Network, Sportsnet\'s Elliotte Friedman said he believes the Devils have been looking at the goalie market. However, he indicated that teams with goalies to spare currently hold all the leverage.Friedman listed Anaheim\'s John Gibson, Calgary\'s Jacob Markstrom, Columbus\' Elvis Merzlikins, Montreal\'s Jake Allen and San Jose\'s Kaapo Kahkonen as potential trade candidates.He said he believes acquiring Gibson would be difficult to do without salary retention by the Ducks, while Markstrom would have to waive his no-movement clause. Merzlikins has struggled this season; no one has yet met the Canadiens\' asking price for Allen, and Kahkonen lacks playoff experience.Friedman also thinks the Devils are interested in bolstering their blueline with Dougie Hamilton sidelined for the rest of the regular season. He could see them going after someone like Calgary\'s Noah Hanifin.Speaking of the Devils, New Jersey Hockey Now\'s James Nichols reported on Sunday that sources claimed they might be willing to part with Michael McLeod after teams expressed interest in the 25-year-old center.Nichols clarified his report the following day after the Devils denied McLeod was available. He indicated that his sources maintain there is strong interest in the young forward, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean he\'s on the trade block.',
