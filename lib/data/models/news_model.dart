    title: 'HOW COULD CONNOR BEDARD\'S INJURY AFFECT HIS CALDER TROPHY BID?',
    text:
        'Chicago Blackhawks star rookie Connor Bedard suffered a setback Friday, when he collided with New Jersey defenseman Brendan Smith and fractured his jaw. The 18-year-old has been far and away the NHL’s top freshman, with 15 goals and 33 points in 39 games. He’s got nine more points than the next-best rookie – Columbus center Adam Fantilli. Bedard’s going to be sidelined indefinitely, possibly four to six weeks, adding to the Hawks’ significant injury woes.By the time Bedard returns, the race for the Calder Trophy as the NHL’s top rookie will probably be much tighter. Along with Fantilli (24 points), the other top rookies this season in terms of points are Minnesota Wild forward Marco Rossi (23 points), and Devils defenseman Luke Hughes (22 points). Those rookies could have between now and February or March to catch up to Bedard in the points race. Given that each of those three are currently averaging about 0.60 points per game, they’ll probably get close to or right at Bedard’s current points total.Let’s presume Bedard’s injury is more severe, and he’s out until early March. That would still give him about 20 regular-season games to get back in top form and once again average nearly one point per game. That would put his production in the area of 55 points, and that’s probably going to be at or near the top of the list of rookies in the points department. Fantilli, Hughes and Rossi will almost assuredly be in that race as well, but they haven’t shown the dominance we’ve seen from Bedard in his first NHL season. We also need to factor in the possibility one of those three rookies also gets injured; if that happens to any of the three we’ve named, catching Bedard will be next to impossible.Most hockey observers projected Bedard to win the Calder this season, including 25 of THN\'s 33 respondents in a pre-season poll, and people have had good reason for that projection. The other rookies will probably be terrific NHLers over the long haul, but at the moment, they’re simply not as good as Bedard. If the voting for the Calder was done today, there’d be no question Bedard should win it. He shouldn’t be pushed out of the Calder race because of this injury. Indeed, when he does return and continues to maul opponents with his craftiness and instincts, Bedard will confirm he’s the best first-year player in the game.',

          'NHL THREE STARS: STARS SECOND-LINER, MAPLE LEAFS GOALIE AND PANTHERS POWER FORWARD IMPRESS',
      text:
          'Welcome back to the three stars of the week, a regular THN.com file in which we pick out three NHL players who had the biggest impact on their team in the last seven days. Let’s get to it:3. MATTHEW TKACHUK, FLORIDA PANTHER Tkachuk was third in the league in points this week but first in points per game, with eight (including five assists) in just three games. One of his three goals was a game-winner against the Vegas Golden Knights.He’s now amassed 27 assists and 35 points in 39 games. The 26-year-old winger is on pace for a 56-assist, 73-point season – while that’s a dropoff of about 30 points from his previous two seasons, Tkachuk is averaging less ice time at 18:52 per game, and the Panthers likely want him to be a little fresher by the playoffs.Tkachuk is earning \$9.5 million this season, so ideally, his totals on offense would be better than they are at the moment. However, Florida is romping right now, winning seven games in a row, and Tkachuk’s contributions are noteworthy. He’s an antagonist, but he can back it up with effective play.We expect his offensive numbers to rise, and if they do, the Panthers should remain at or near the top of the Atlantic Division.2. MARTIN JONES, TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS Jones began the season with the AHL’s Toronto Marlies but was recalled in December after Joseph Woll\'s injury. Jones rewarded GM Brad Treliving’s faith in him with an excellent showing this past week.The 33-year-old netminder went 3-0-0 with a sterling 0.66 goals-against average, a .976 save percentage and one shutout. He now has a record of 7-3-0 in 11 appearances this season, along with a 2.08 GAA and .932 SP in that span. Those numbers are his best since the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons when he was the top goalie for the San Jose Sharks.Jones is earning just \$875,000 this year, making him one of the best bargains in the league right now. Maple Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe is going to give youngster Woll opportunities in net when he returns from injury, but Jones has established himself as a solid option as a tandem mate for Woll.At his age, Jones is expected to lose a step, but the opposite has been true; he’s been terrific positionally, he hasn’t gotten rattled on the rare occasion he does surrender a goal, and he’s allowed Toronto’s offense to power the Buds to victory. Treliving couldn’t have asked for more from Jones than what he’s delivering, and the Leafs are going to ride him until the wheels fall off.1. MASON MARCHMENT, DALLAS STARSMarchment tied for the league lead this week with six assists and nine points in four games while averaging just 16:15 of ice time. All six of his assists came at even-strength, and he now has 13 goals and 30 points in 38 games this season. The 28-year-old is on pace for a 28-goal, 64-point campaign, which would demolish his current career highs of 18 goals and 47 points, both set with Florida in 2021-22.',

      title: 'THN ARCHIVE: BREAKING DOWN HOCKEY\'S UNWRITTEN CODE',
      text:
          'The hockey world has its official rules, but it also has an unwritten code players and hockey people live by. And in this cover story from The Hockey News’ Dec. 7, 2004 edition – Vol. 58, Issue 15 – senior writer Mark Brender wrote on the code itself.(And here’s your regular reminder – for full access to THN’s 76-year Archive, you need only subscribe to the magazine.)In Brender’s story, he chronicles all the unwritten rules players live by. Some of them have changed since the story was published, but for the most part, the unwritten code remains intact. And in Brender’s story, he writes about a number of areas: in the dressing room; on the ice; during the game; the fighter’s code; after the game; on the road; and around the rink. Each area has its own regulations, written and otherwise, and players and hockey people abide by them each and every year.For example, Brender spoke to then-Canadiens blueliner Lyle Odelein wanted to fight in the midst of a one-sided game against Buffalo. Odelein wanted to take on someone from the Sabres, and when they didn’t respond to his liking, Odelein took matters into his own hands.“I skated by the bench and I told Teddy, ‘OK, Teddy, throw out your boys,” Odelein told Brender. “And he basically told me, go get ’em myself. So I said, ‘All right Teddy’. And that’s why I shot the puck at their bench.”Meanwhile, on the road in the minors, rookie players are given the task of cleaning the bus players ride on. And in-room politics can force rookies to take on a big challenge in that regard.“If some guys don’t like some young guys,” says John Slaney, a veteran blueliner for the American League’s Philadelphia Phantoms, “you can make the bus pretty dirty.”All in all, Brender covered a slew of rules from “the code”, and most of them still apply to this day. Then-Sabres coach Ted Nolan spoke about the code from his point of view.“I’ve always loved aggressive hockey, but I don’t like stupid hockey,” Nolan said. “If people want to get even, my theory is you get even at the beginning of the game when the game is in reach, not when it’s out of reach. That’s when people start doing some stupid things. I always took the reverse action to that. When it was over, it was over. We’ll get them next time.”',

      title: 'NEW JERSEY DEVILS STILL SEEK A GOALTENDER AND A DEFENSEMAN',
      text:
          'The New Jersey Devils were 10-9-1 in their first 20 games, sitting 12th overall in the Eastern Conference as of Nov. 28. That prompted speculation GM Tom Fitzgerald was in the market for a goaltending upgrade over his then-tandem of Vitek Vanecek and Akira Schmid.Since then, the Devils went 10-5-1 heading into Friday\'s matchup with the Chicago Blackhawks and are jockeying for the final Eastern Conference wild-card berth. Nevertheless, speculation persists that Fitzgerald is still seeking help between the pipes.lVanecek has a record of 13-7-1, but his 3.35 goals-against average and .883 save percentage rank among the worst for NHL starters this season. Schmid fared little better before his recent assignment to their AHL affiliate in Utica, going 5-7-1 with 3.26 GAA and .893 SP. Call-up Nico Daws has won his two starts with a 2.52 GAA and .906 SP.During an appearance Wednesday on the NHL Network, Sportsnet\'s Elliotte Friedman said he believes the Devils have been looking at the goalie market. However, he indicated that teams with goalies to spare currently hold all the leverage.Friedman listed Anaheim\'s John Gibson, Calgary\'s Jacob Markstrom, Columbus\' Elvis Merzlikins, Montreal\'s Jake Allen and San Jose\'s Kaapo Kahkonen as potential trade candidates.He said he believes acquiring Gibson would be difficult to do without salary retention by the Ducks, while Markstrom would have to waive his no-movement clause. Merzlikins has struggled this season; no one has yet met the Canadiens\' asking price for Allen, and Kahkonen lacks playoff experience.Friedman also thinks the Devils are interested in bolstering their blueline with Dougie Hamilton sidelined for the rest of the regular season. He could see them going after someone like Calgary\'s Noah Hanifin.Speaking of the Devils, New Jersey Hockey Now\'s James Nichols reported on Sunday that sources claimed they might be willing to part with Michael McLeod after teams expressed interest in the 25-year-old center.Nichols clarified his report the following day after the Devils denied McLeod was available. He indicated that his sources maintain there is strong interest in the young forward, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean he\'s on the trade block.',

          'NHL\'s Weekly Best: Stars\' Second-Liner, Leafs\' Goalie, and Panthers\' Winger Shine',
      text:
          'In this edition of the weekly NHL three stars, we highlight the trio of players who stood out with their exceptional performances over the past seven days. Without further ado, let\'s dive into the athletes who have been pivotal in their team\'s successes.Matthew Tkachuk, Florida PanthersMatthew Tkachuk of the Florida Panthers lands the third star, not just for his ranking of third in the league for points this week, but for his impressive points-per-game average. Netting five assists and eight points across just three matchups, Tkachuk\'s offensive prowess was on full display. One of his trio of goals clinched a victory over the Vegas Golden Knights.With a season tally of 27 assists and 35 points in 39 games, the 26-year-old winger is tracking towards a 56-assist and 73-point season. Although this forecast is a reduction from his previous two years by about 30 points, it\'s worth noting that Tkachuk\'s ice time has decreased to an average of 18:52 per game. This strategic choice could be a move by the Panthers to ensure his vitality for the playoffs.Commanding a salary of \$9.5 million this season, expectations for Tkachuk\'s offensive output are high. The Panthers, however, are on a hot streak with seven consecutive wins, and Tkachuk\'s role has been significant. Known for his agitating style, he\'s proven that his contributions extend beyond irritation, providing substantial impact on the ice. It\'s anticipated that his offensive stats will escalate, which should help the Panthers maintain their stronghold in the Atlantic Division. Martin Jones, Toronto Maple Leaf Starting the season with the AHL\'s Toronto Marlies, Martin Jones was summoned to the Maple Leafs following Joseph Woll\'s injury in December. Jones has since repaid GM Brad Treliving\'s confidence with a string of commendable performances this past week Jones recorded a perfect 3-0-0 with an exceptional 0.66 goals-against average, a .976 save percentage, and a shutout to his name. Now boasting a 7-3-0 record in 11 games this season, his 2.08 GAA and .932 SP are reminiscent of his standout seasons as the primary goaltender for the San Jose Sharks during 2016-17 and 2017-18.Earning a modest \$875,000 this year, Jones is proving to be one of the NHL\'s most valuable deals. Maple Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe plans to provide the young Woll with goaltending opportunities upon his return from injury, but Jones has solidified his position as a reliable partner in the net tandem. Despite his age, Jones has defied expectations, demonstrating excellent positional play and composure. His steady presence in goal has allowed Toronto\'s offense to steer the team to victory, and the Leafs are poised to maximize his performance for as long as possible.Mason Marchment, Dallas Stars, Mason Marchment ties for the lead in league assists this week, collecting six assists and nine points over four games while logging an average of just 16:15 on the ice per contest. Impressively, each assist was earned at even strength. Currently, Marchment has accumulated 13 goals and 30 points in 38 games this season.',

          'THN Retrospective: Deciphering the Unwritten Rules of Hockey Culture',
      text:
          'The realm of hockey is governed by more than just the official regulations; it\'s steeped in a culture of unwritten rules that players and hockey insiders adhere to religiously. In a throwback to The Hockey News\' December 7, 2004 issue (Volume 58, Issue 15), senior writer Mark Brender delves into the mysterious "code" that dictates conduct within the sport. For those eager to explore the full history within THN\'s 76-year archive, exclusive access is available with a magazine subscription.Brender\'s exploration unveils the tacit agreements that shape behavior in various aspects of hockey life: locker room etiquette, on-ice interactions, game-time dynamics, the ethics of fighting, post-game conduct, the protocol of road trips, and general arena life. These unwritten rules, although evolving, have remarkably stood the test of time.Highlighting one of many anecdotes, Brender recounts an incident involving Lyle Odelein, a defenseman for the Montreal Canadiens at the time, during a lopsided match against the Buffalo Sabres. Odelein, itching for a fight, was met with indifference by the Sabres. In a show of defiance, he recalls telling Sabres coach Ted Nolan to "throw out your boys," only to be challenged to take matters into his own hands. This led Odelein to famously shoot the puck at the Sabres\' bench in retaliation.The complexities of the unwritten code extend to life on the road, particularly in the minor leagues where rookies often bear the brunt of cleaning the team bus. John Slaney, a seasoned defenseman with the Philadelphia Phantoms of the American League, notes that locker room dynamics can sometimes result in rookies facing a particularly challenging cleanup if they\'re not in favor with the veterans.Brender\'s comprehensive feature on "the code" touches upon numerous facets of this hockey tradition that continue to influence the game today. Giving voice to the perspective of coaches, Ted Nolan, then helming the Sabres, shared his philosophy. A lover of aggressive but smart hockey, Nolan disapproved of settling scores late in a game when the outcome was already decided, preferring to address such matters early on when the stakes were still high.Through this insightful glimpse into hockey\'s unwritten code, Mark Brender captures the enduring customs that define the sport\'s unique culture, echoing through the locker rooms and onto the ice of every hockey rink.',

      text:
          'As the New Jersey Devils navigated through the initial 20 games of the season with a modest 10-9-1 record, they found themselves in the 12th spot within the Eastern Conference as of November 28. This standing triggered rumors that General Manager Tom Fitzgerald was on the lookout for an upgrade in the goaltender position, looking to improve upon the performance of Vitek Vanecek and Akira Schmid.Since the early rumors, the Devils have shown improvement, posting a 10-5-1 record leading up to their game against the Chicago Blackhawks, contending for the coveted wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference. Despite the uptick in performance, there remains ongoing speculation that Fitzgerald hasn\'t shelved the idea of reinforcing his goaltending lineup.Vanecek\'s season stats of 13 wins, 7 losses, and 1 overtime loss reveal a less than stellar 3.35 goals-against average and a .883 save percentage, which is considered subpar for a starting NHL goaltender. Schmid, prior to his reassignment to the AHL\'s Utica Comets, recorded a 5-7-1 tally, a 3.26 GAA, and a .893 SP. Meanwhile, Nico Daws showed promise with two wins in two starts, boasting a 2.52 GAA and a .906 SP.Elliotte Friedman of Sportsnet, during a segment on the NHL Network, expressed his belief that the Devils\' management has been actively exploring the goalie market. However, he noted that the teams with available goaltenders are currently in a position of power. He identified potential trade targets, including John Gibson from Anaheim, Jacob Markstrom from Calgary, Elvis Merzlikins from Columbus, Jake Allen from Montreal, and Kaapo Kahkonen from San Jose.Friedman also pointed out the challenges in acquiring such talent: Gibson\'s move may necessitate the Ducks to retain some of his salary; Markstrom has a no-movement clause to waive; Merzlikins is also not having his best season; the asking price for Allen has yet to be met; and Kahkonen has limited postseason experience.On the defensive front, with Dougie Hamilton out for the remainder of the season, Friedman anticipates the Devils might look to strengthen their defense, potentially targeting a player like Noah Hanifin of Calgary.In a related story, James Nichols of New Jersey Hockey Now reported that the Devils could be open to trading Michael McLeod, the 25-year-old center, following interest from other teams. However, the Devils organization has refuted the claim that McLeod is available for trade. Nichols later adjusted his report, citing that while there is indeed significant interest in McLeod, this does not necessarily suggest he is on the trading block.',
